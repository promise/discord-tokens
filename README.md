# discord-tokens

This repository is primarily to reset discord tokens. All tokens sent here will automatically be [grabbed by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) and get sent over to Discord for deletion.

All tokens stored here is only stored for the reset to happen, and the repository [cleans itself](/.github/workflows/clean.yml) every week.
