# discord-tokens

This repository is primarily to reset discord tokens. All tokens sent here will automatically be grabbed by GitHub and get sent over to Discord for deletion.

All tokens stored here is only stored for the reset to happen, and the repository [cleans itself](/.github/workflows/clean.yml) every week.
